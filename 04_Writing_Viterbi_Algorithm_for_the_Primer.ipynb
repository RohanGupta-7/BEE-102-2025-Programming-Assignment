    "# Understanding the Viterbi Algorithm for DNA Sequence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In our BEE-102 class, we've been studying this cool algorithm called Viterbi that helps us figure out hidden patterns in DNA sequences. It's basically used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states (like whether a part of DNA is an exon or intron) based on the nucleotide sequence we can observe. It's pretty neat once you get the hang of it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's a Hidden Markov Model?\n",
    "Before diving into Viterbi, I should explain what a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is. It's like having two parallel processes:\n",
    "- One process that we can't directly see (the hidden states)\n",
    "- Another process that we can observe (the emissions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In DNA analysis:\n",
    "- The hidden states might be things like exons (E), introns (I), and splice sites (5)\n",
    "- What we actually observe are just the nucleotides (A, T, G, C)"

    "## The Problem We're Solving\n",
    "We have a DNA sequence like \"CTTCATGTGAAAGCAGACGTAAGTCA\", and we want to know which parts are most likely exons, introns, or splice sites. But we can't directly see these features - we have to infer them from the patterns of nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Viterbi Works\n",
    "The Viterbi algorithm is all about finding the most likely path through hidden states. It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting from the beginning of the sequence\n",
    "2. For each position, calculating the most likely state based on:\n",
    "   - What we've seen so far\n",
    "   - The transition probabilities between states\n",
    "   - The emission probabilities of observing particular nucleotides\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool thing is it doesn't have to try every possible path (which would be CRAZY for long sequences) - it uses dynamic programming to be efficient."

    "- I: Intron regions (non-coding DNA) \n",
    "- 5: 5' splice site (transition region between exon and intron)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transition Matrix\n",
    "This shows the probability of moving from one state to another:\n",
    "- P(E→E): How likely we stay in an exon\n",
    "- P(E→5): How likely we transition from exon to splice site\n",
    "- P(5→I): How likely we go from splice site to intron\n",
    "- P(I→I): How likely we stay in an intron\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Emission Matrix\n",
    "This shows how likely each state is to emit particular nucleotides:\n",
    "- P(A|E): Probability of seeing an A in an exon\n",
    "- P(G|I): Probability of seeing a G in an intron\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using Log Probabilities\n",
    "One tricky part is that when we multiply many small probabilities, we can get numerical underflow. To avoid this, we use log probabilities. Adding log probabilities is equivalent to multiplying regular probabilities."

    "The Viterbi algorithm is super useful for decoding the hidden structure in biological sequences. Once you implement it, you can tweak the parameters to better identify different genomic features like coding regions, introns, and splice sites. It's definitely one of the most important algorithms we've learned about in this class!"
